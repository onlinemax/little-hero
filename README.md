# How to Contribute to the Little Hero Project on GitHub

## Introduction
This guide will teach you how to contribute to the Little Hero project. It covers everything from bringing the code to your local computer (your own machine) to sending your changes back to the main project. Youâ€™ll be making something called a "pull request" to suggest your changes for review.

### What You'll Need:
- A GitHub account (sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com) if you donâ€™t have one).
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a tool to edit the code.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository (Initial Setup)
Youâ€™ll clone the project to your local computer.

1. **Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**.
2. **Open the Terminal in VSCode**:
   - Click on **View > Terminal** from the top menu, or press `Ctrl + ` (backtick) on your keyboard.
3. **Copy the link to the repository**:
   - On the GitHub repository page (which should be `https://github.com/onlinemax/little-hero`), click the green **"Code"** button and copy the link under **HTTPS**.
4. **Clone the repository to your local machine** by typing this command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onlinemax/little-hero.git
   ```
5. Press **Enter**. This will download the project files to your computer.

### Step 2: Pull the Latest Changes (Subsequent Updates)
After the initial setup, you can easily update your local copy with changes from the remote repository using `git pull`.

1. **Navigate to Your Local Repository**:
   - In the terminal, use the `cd` command to change your directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/little-hero
   ```
   - Replace `path/to/your/little-hero` with the actual path to your local repository.

2. **Pull the Latest Changes**:
   - Run the following command to fetch and merge changes from the remote `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Handling Conflicts**:
   - If there are any conflicts, Git will notify you. You'll need to resolve them manually, add the resolved files, and commit again.

### Step 3: Make Changes to the Code
Now that the project is on your computer, you can edit the code.

1. **Open the project in VSCode**:
   - In VSCode, click **File > Open Folder**, then navigate to the `little-hero` folder and click **Open**.
   
2. **Edit the code**:
   - Browse through the files and make your changes. If you're unsure where to start, follow the instructions in the project's README or ask the project maintainers for guidance.

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes
After making changes, you need to "commit" them (which means saving the changes with a message explaining what you did).

1. **Open the Terminal in VSCode** if it's not already open.
2. **Add your changes** by typing:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   This tells Git to track the changes you made.

3. **Commit your changes** with a message describing what you did:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```
   Example: 
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fixed the hero's attack function"
   ```

### Step 5: Push Your Changes to GitHub
Now, you'll send your changes to the main repository. All pushes will automatically become pull requests.

1. **Push your changes** by typing:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request
When you push your changes, GitHub will automatically create a pull request for you to review.

1. **Go to the repository on GitHub** (e.g., [Little Hero GitHub](https://github.com/onlinemax/little-hero)).
2. **Click the "Pull Requests" tab** at the top of the page.
3. Youâ€™ll see your recently pushed branch listed there. Click on it to open the pull request.
4. **Review the changes**: GitHub will show the differences between your code and the main project.
5. **Create the pull request**:
   - Add a **title** and **description** of the changes you made.
   - Click **"Create Pull Request"**.

Now, the project maintainers will review your changes, and if everything looks good, theyâ€™ll merge your work into the main project!
